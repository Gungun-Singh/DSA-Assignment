 24. Explain the concept of bit manipulation and its advantages in algorithm design. 

What is Bit Manipulation?
Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically changing individual bits (0s and 1s) within a binary number using bitwise operators.

These operators include:
& (AND)
| (OR)
^ (XOR)
~ (NOT)
<< (left shift)


 Advantages in Algorithm Design:
1.High Performance (Speed)
Bitwise operations are low-level, often executed in 1 CPU cycle.
Great for time-critical code (like in competitive programming or system-level code).

2.Memory Efficiency
Instead of using entire data structures (like boolean arrays), a single integer can represent multiple flags using bits.

3.Simpler Logic for Certain Problems
Powers of 2, parity checks, toggling bits, and more can be done in very few lines with bit magic.
