39. Explain the difference between subsets and permutations with examples. 

Subsets:
A subset is a selection of elements from a set, where the order does not matter.

Total number of subsets of a set with n elements: 
2^ùëõ  (including the empty set).

Example:
For the set {1, 2, 3}, the subsets are:
{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}


Permutations:
A permutation is an arrangement of all elements from a set, where the order does matter.

Total number of permutations of n elements: 
n! (factorial of n).

Example:
For the set {1, 2, 3}, the permutations are:
{1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, {3, 2, 1}


Hence,
Order: Permutations consider order; subsets do not.

Count: Subsets are exponentially fewer than permutations for the same set.
